# Course structure

Each spreadsheet course consists of chapters, which consist of workbooks, which consist of exercises.
Let's explain each part.

## Course

A course is the top level of the content, it's the biggest collection of content available.
Typically a spreadsheet course is about a specific topic or use case, similar to other DataCamp
courses.

## Chapter

Each course consists of a number of chapters. Spreadsheet chapters are about subtopics of the
course's topic, similar to how the division is made for regular DataCamp chapters.

## Workbook

The workbook is the first bit where a spreadsheet course differentiates with a regular DataCamp
course. Each spreadsheet chapter is divided into one or more workbooks. You can think of it as a way
to subdivide your chapters into chunks of exercises that are about the same dataset.

The division in workbooks will not be visible directly for the students, but it will be obvious from
the authoring interface. It will help you as an author to group exercises that are about the same
dataset together.

## Exercise

The atomic piece of content. An exercise will be a specific problem that has to be solved by a
student by following a set of instructions. An exercise roughly consists of sample data that the
student sees when they arrive on the exercise, a solution that they need to provide, some
instructions and a test whether they succeeded. The sample data of an exercise will always be a
slight mutation on the dataset which is defined in the workbook it belongs to.
