# General

Exercises are built inside the **workbook source** of a workbook. Each exercise consists of 4
separate sheets: **Meta**, **Sample**, **Solution** and **SCT**. More details on each of these is
provided in this section.

The exercise sheets must follow a strict naming convention, sensitive to caps and spaces:

```
Exercise <exercise_number> - <Meta|Sample|Solution|SCT>
```

As an example, here is a workbook source that has 2 exercises:
