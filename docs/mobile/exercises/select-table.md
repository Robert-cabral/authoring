# Select Table

A Select Table exercise is essentially identical to a [Select Output
exercise](/mobile/exercises/select-output.md), but instead of a choosing the
correct `output` block, students are asked to choose the correct `table`
block. This is ideal for exercises when the output of a code block is better
represented as a table - SQL queries, for example.

```yaml
# SELECT *
- key: # generate me!
  tabs:
    - key: team_mobile
      type: table
  context: "`SELECT *` will pull every column from a table."
  code: "SELECT * FROM team_mobile"
  table:
    data: |-
      Name,Awesomeness,Role
      Spencer,100,Content
      Boris,100,Product
      Jens,100,Code
    message: "Showing 3 out of 3 rows."
  distractor_table:
    - option:
        data: |-
          Name,Awesomeness,Role
          Spencer,0,Content
          Boris,100,Product
          Jens,100,Code
        message: "Showing 3 out of 3 rows."
      feedback: "Spencer is also awesome."
    - option: |-
        Name,Awesomeness,Role
        Spencer,100,Content
        Boris,0,Product
        Jens,100,Code
      feedback: "Boris is also awesome."
```

The `option`s in the `distractor_table` block have a structure identical to that
of a `table` block (because they are also tables). Refer to the [documentation
for `table` blocks](/mobile/exercises/README.md/#table) for more information.
