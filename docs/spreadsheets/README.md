# DataCamp spreadsheets

[DataCamp spreadsheets](https://spreadsheets.datacamp.com) is a new way to teach your students
spreadsheets. Since there are substantial difference between spreadsheets content and other content
on DataCamp, this document will guide you through the authoring process of DataCamp spreadsheet
courses.

1. [Course structure](course-structure.md): defines the way spreadsheet courses are built up out of
   chapters, workbooks and exercises
