# Welcome

Anyone can create content for free using our authoring tools, then make that content available to others. This documentation will help you do that by explaining what our various tools do and what content they can be used to create.

If you'd like to make your content freely available to the general public via the [Community section](https://www.datacamp.com/community/) of our website, you can get started on your content right away and reach out to [support@datacamp.com](mailto:support@datacamp.com) when it's done.

If you're interested in creating premium content on [datacamp.com](https://www.datacamp.com/) available only to DataCamp subscribers, you can [apply here](https://www.datacamp.com/create/) to be considered. If you are selected to create premium content, we will work closely with you to plan and develop the material so that it fits neatly among our other premium offerings.

# Types of Content

DataCamp supports several different types of training content, each serving a particular purpose:

* *Courses* teach new data science material.
* *Challenges* allow students to practice what they've learned in courses.
* *Projects* provide an opportunity to apply things in a real-world setting.
* *Mobile courses* provide students the ability to learn and practice topics on the go.

### Courses

The purpose of a DataCamp course is to teach students something new. For example, our [Introduction to SQL for Data Science](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-sql-for-data-science) course teaches students the basics of using SQL in a data science context, covering basic `SELECT` statements, filtering, aggregate functions, etc.

### Challenges

Challenges give students a chance to practice what they've learned in courses. For example, our [Pandas Foundations](https://challenges.datacamp.com/practice/300) challenges test students' ability to perform basic tasks with the popular Python package introduced in [our course](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/pandas-foundations) with the same name.

> #### info::Note
> Challenge authoring is only available to invited instructors at the moment, but should be available to everyone in the near future. If you're interested in creating some, please contact [spencer@datacamp.com](mailto:spencer@datacamp.com) for more info!
>
> In the meantime, you can browse the relevant [documentation](challenges/README.md).

### Projects

Projects allow students to apply what they've learned in a more open-ended and real-world data science context. For example, our project about [Dr. Semmelweis and the discovery of handwashing](https://www.datacamp.com/projects/20) allows students to analyze data on the life-saving impact of handwashing in the 1800s.

### Mobile

DataCamp for Mobile makes it possible for students to engage with their learning
anytime and anywhere. It is available for both
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.datacamp) and
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/datacamp-learn-r-python/id1263413087). There
are two types of mobile content: full mobile courses (more like a desktop
course), and mobile practice content (more like desktop challenges).

If you're interested in creating a mobile course or mobile practice exercises for your existing desktop course, please contact [spencer@datacamp.com](mailto:spencer@datacamp.com) for more info!
