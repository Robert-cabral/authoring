# Mobile exercises

There are roughly 5 exercise types available to you as an author on DataCamp
Mobile:

| Type                                                    | Description                                                               |
| :---                                                    | :----------                                                               |
| [Select Output](/mobile/exercises/select-output.md)     | What is the output of this code?                                          |
| [Select Table](/mobile/exercises/select-table.md)       | What is the output of this code? (When the output is a table, eg for SQL) |
| [Select Code](/mobile/exercises/select-code.md)         | Select the code to return the output.                                     |
| [Tap](/mobile/exercises/tap.md)                         | Complete the code to return the output.                                   |
| [Multiple Choice](/mobile/exercises/multiple-choice.md) | Answer the multiple choice question.                                      |
| [Reorder](/mobile/exercises/reorder.md)                 | Reorder the code to return the output.                                    |

...but they all share a similar structure. In general, you can think of an
exercise as a short code vignette comprising various blocks in the following
sequence:

```yaml
# print()
-  key: # generate me!
  context: "`print()` outputs to the screen. Whatever you put between the parentheses will be output! E.g. `print(5)` will output `5`!"
  question: "What is the output of this code?" # this is the default
  code: "print(42)"
  output: "42"
  distractor_output:
    - option: "4"
      feedback: "`print()` will output all of whatever is between the parentheses, not just the first part."
    - option: "2"
      feedback: "`print()` will output all of whatever is between the parentheses, not just the last part."
```

In the example above, the use of the `distractor_output` field indicates this
exercise will be a Select Output exercise. Other distractor types will result in
different exercise types:

* `distractor_output` -> [Select Output](/mobile/exercises/select-output.md)
* `distractor_table`  -> [Select Table](/mobile/exercises/select-table.md)
* `distractor_code`   -> [Select Code](/mobile/exercises/select-code.md)
* `distractor_blanks` -> [Tap](/mobile/exercises/tap.md)
* `distractor_text`   -> [Multiple Choice](/mobile/exercises/multiple-choice.md)

The only exercise type that does not require a distractor field is the
[Reorder](/mobile/exercises/reorder.md) exercise.

Let's dig into each of the blocks...

## topic

```yaml
# print()
```

Even though it's not part of the exercise itself, it's a good idea to comment
your exercises so you can quickly remind yourself what each exercise is designed
to teach or test. In fact, it can be helpful to start by outlining a whole
lesson with a scaffolding of comments before expanding the exercises.

## key

```yaml
key: c11dbdf1-49c9-408a-a1e4-885431af2196
```

This is a unique UUID for the exercise. You can find some tips for working
with/generating UUIDs [here](/mobile/authoring.md/#working-with-uuids).

## context

```yaml
context: "`print()` outputs to the screen. Whatever you put between the parentheses will be output! E.g. `print(5)` will output `5`!"
```

This is where you can provide exposition necessary to introduce a new
concept. It should be kept as minimal as possible (no longer than 150
characters). It's good to shoot for a lighter, more informal feel here than on
desktop. This field supports markdown elements like `inline code` and
***emboldening***. Emojis are not just supported, they're encouraged!

## question

```yaml
question: "" # this is the default
```

This field is always optional. It will override the default question for the
relevant exercise type. You can see the default question for each exercise type
in the table above. Don't change this unless you absolutely need to for an
exercise to make sense.

## code

```yaml
code: "print(42)"
```

This is the code! Anything you here should be syntactically correct, executable
code. The format of the code block can vary slightly for different exercise
types, for example reorder and tap exercises. See the documentation for those
exercise types to get the details.

## output

```yaml
output: "42"
```

This is the output generated by the code in a code block. That means anything
that would get printed to the console in an interactive Python or R terminal
session.

## distractors

```yaml
distractor_output:
  - option: "4"
    feedback: "`print()` will output all of whatever is between the parentheses, not just the first part."
  - option: "2"
    feedback: "`print()` will output all of whatever is between the parentheses, not just the last part."
```

Regardless of the exercise type, the distractor field is always a list of
distractors (AKA wrong answers). Each individual distractor in the list has two
elements: `option`, the incorrect answer itself, and `feedback`, the feedback
message that students will see if they incorrectly choose that distractor. Try
not to ask questions or use exclamation marks in feedback messages - they should
be clear but not aggressive.

> #### info::Note
> The distractors are one of the most important pieces of a mobile exercise. Not
> only does the distractors block determine the rendered exercise type, but an
> effective mobile exercise predicts the mistakes that a student is likely to
> make, and then provides useful `feedback` explaining why that distractor is
> wrong!

[Reorder](/mobile/exercises/reorder.md) and [Tap](/mobile/exercises/tap.md)
exercises in particular have special requirements. Refer to the documentation
pages of those exercise types for more information.

# Other available blocks

## table

```yaml
table:
  data: |-
    name,birthdate
    50 Cent,1975-07-06
    Aaliyah,1979-01-16
    Aaron Yoo,1979-05-12
  message: "Showing 3 out of 537 rows"
```

You can opt to use a `table` block instead of an `output` block, for example
when displaying the output of a SQL query, which is more appropriate as a
table. A table field has two subfields. First is `data`, which contains the
actual table data as comma separated values. They needn't be aligned, but they
can be and sometimes this improves readability.  The second is `message`, which
contains a short string of text that is displayed in the footer of the
table. The most common use for the table message is to indicate row truncation,
because tables should not be displayed with more than 5 rows as a general
rule. If you *are* truncating the result, the `message` field is mandatory,
otherwise it is not. The standard format for indicating truncation is the one
featured in the example above: `"Showing n out of N rows"`.

## image

```yaml
image: assets/images/my-cool-plot.png
```

You can insert an image block into your exercise simply by specifying the path
to a PNG file. The image will be placed below the question. This is useful when
teaching things like plotting. Be mindful of image asset size, because these
images will be downloaded to students' phones, often over a cellular data
connection.

![Example image](/images/mobile/image-small.png)

## context image

```yaml
context:
  text: "Below is a line plot of life expectancy for different countries against their GDP per capita."
  image: assets/gdp-life-line.png
```

If you want your image to appear _above_ the question, you can use a
**multi-part** context block rather than a simple text one. To do so, put the
text of your context into a subfield called `text`, and then add nest `image`
field into `context` as well, as demonstrated above.

![Example context image](/images/mobile/image-context-small.png)

## feedback_wrong

```yaml
feedback_wrong: "Don't forget that R is 1-indexed, not 0-indexed like Python."
```

The `feedback_wrong` field is the fallback feedback message when a particular
distractor hasn't been supplied with one. Usually, you should be giving specific
feedback for each individual distractor, because specific, enlightening feedback
messages are one of the most effective ways of teaching on DataCamp for
Mobile. If you find that the same feedback message is appropriate for multiple
distrators, however, this field is provided for convenience.

![An example of a feedback message](/images/mobile/feedback-wrong-small.png)

## tabs

```yaml
tabs:
  - key: people
    type: table
```

Tabs appear in the top right of the exercise and serve as a way to display
datasets or files. The appropriate asset must be defined in the [`assets`
section of the course manifest](/mobile/repo-structure.md#assets-metadata). A tab
field has two subfields: `key`, which is the alias for the asset as defined in
the manifest, and `type`, which specifies how to render the asset. Currently
only `file` and `table` are supported.

An example of a `dataset` rendered as a `table`:
