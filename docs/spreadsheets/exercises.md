# Exercises

The following section will be about editing exercises. Since this is the most substantial part of
authoring, we divided the section in three subsections:

1. [General](exercises/general.md): explain different sheets needed to author an exercise
1. [Content guidelines](exercises/content-guidelines.md): what are the content guidelines and how
   are they enforced
1. [Writing SCTs](exercises/writing-scts.md): write correct SCTs or Submission Correctness Tests
